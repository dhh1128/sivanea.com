After the divorce of her parents, Mary Wilkerson lived with many different relatives as a child. She once lived homeless in a care in the desert near Las Vegas. She married young. Her husband, Byron, went to fight World War II in Europe, leaving her with small children to feed and care for. She lost triplets who were born early, and had to make difficult accommodations in her life for a mother-in-law who was hard to live with. Nonetheless, Mary was an upbeat person, and she never stopped opening her arms and her heart to others. She told people to keep their chin up. She was a bit of a card sharp, walked every day, and loved to laugh and spend time with friends and loved ones. Lyrics are by [me collaborating with AI](ai-collab).

<p class="poetry">
[verse 1]
Born in a boxcar, mountain pass 
Cold wind whistling through thin walls 
From hand to land, no steady face 
Too young to know who’d stay at all

[refrain]
And she loved 
again, again

[verse 2]
Love came quick, then he was gone 
Letters late, then silence long 
Winter fighting, far from home 
Not knowing if he’d come at all

[refrain]
And she loved 
again, again

[verse 3]
Three born early, could not breathe 
No air, no heat to hold them here 
Hospital glass, no help for blue 
Children home, and more to come

[refrain]
And she loved 
again, again

[verse 4]
Small shared house for twenty-three years 
Smoke all night as kids lost sleep 
Kitchen claimed by someone else 
Knowing who would never leave

[refrain]
And she loved 
again, again

[verse 5]
Cards dealt out, walks, laughter shared  
Friendships fed from written years  
Stories told, odd facts she stored  
Hands once held now holding hers  

[refrain]
And she loved  
again, again  

[outro]
again.
