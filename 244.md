I took this shot during a visit to Buenos Aires a few years ago. It was June (winter) there; hence the folks in jackets.

I like the interesting shapes in the photo--the triangle outlined in yellow in the foreground, the funky pentagonal intersection. The V formed by the skyline along the tops of the buildings is perfect for art teachers who want students to notice perspective.
