<p style="font-style:italic;font-size:90%;color:#777;">For Ken and Beryl Griffiths; see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/eccl/11.1-2?lang=eng#1" target="_blank">Ecclesiastes 11:1-2</a>.</p>

<p class="poetry">Ripples run with every loving cast &mdash; 
Gentle smiles to firm up feeble knees,
Loving tears to strengthen weary hands...
Yes, ripples run &mdash; 
A portion to seven, and also to eight...
And to one...
Gentleness,
Meekness,
And love unfeigned.</p>

<p class="poetry">Then moving one by one away
The ripples glide to distant shores
And there is silence, many days

And then the ripples come again &mdash; 
joyful strides of confidence and faith
grateful tears, conviction, proven hearts...
Yes, ripples run &mdash; 
From the fifteen.
And the one...
Friendship,
Love,
And bread.</p>
