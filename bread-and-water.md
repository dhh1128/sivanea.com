<p style="font-style:italic;font-size:90%;color:#777;">For Ken and Beryl Griffiths; see <a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/eccl/11.1-2?lang=eng#1" target="_blank">Ecclesiastes 11:1-2</a>.</p>
Ripples run with every loving cast--
Gentle smiles to firm up feeble knees,
Loving tears to strengthen weary hands...
Yes, ripples run--
A portion to seven, and also to eight...
And to one...
Gentleness,
Meekness,
And love unfeigned.

Then moving one by one away
The ripples glide to distant shores
And there is silence, many days

And then the ripples come again--
joyful strides of confidence and faith
grateful tears, conviction, proven hearts...
Yes, ripples run--
From the fifteen.
And the one...
Friendship,
Love,
And bread.
