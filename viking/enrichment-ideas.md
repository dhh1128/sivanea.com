The books I like best are the ones I ponder, discuss, and share with friends. I'd like <em>Viking</em> to be that sort of book for you. Here are some suggestions to enrich your reading experience:

<strong>1. Invite me (or one of my characters) to your book group.</strong>

I'd be happy to join your book group by chat or skype for a few minutes. This is your chance to ask me what I intended, why I put something in or left it out, or what the writing experience was like. Or, for a truly unique experience, why not engage directly with Rafa or Julie or even 1291? All of them tell me they are happy to answer emails or even chat in real-time with readers. I'll bet you've never been in a virtual hang-out with an alien before... :-)

If this sounds interesting, drop me a line using the form on the <a href="http://sivanea.com/contact">Contact page</a>.

<strong>2. Share your own fiction or artwork in the <em>Viking</em> universe.</strong>

I'd love to see what your imagination does with the milieu of the book. If it's of general interest, I'll post it in a gallery here on the website. Contact me by email (first dot last at gmail).

<strong>3. Review the <a href="http://sivanea.com/viking/discussion-questions" target="_blank">suggested discussion questions</a>.</strong>

<strong>4. Submit your own favorite quote on the <a href="http://sivanea.com/viking/discussion-questions" target="_blank">quotes page</a>.</strong>

<strong>5. <a href="http://sivanea.com/viking/cover-design">View the finalists in the cover design contest</a> from which the cover was selected.</strong>

Which one do you like best? Do any of them make you feel differently about the book?
