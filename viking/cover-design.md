Cover design for Viking was done by LioArtimis, through 99designs.com. Over 100 cover designs were submitted. <a href="https://99designs.com/book-cover-design/contests/help-individual-author-book-magazine-cover-181010/poll/jdv8ew/results" target="_blank">Here</a> are the five finalists, together with the feedback that helped me choose. (Note the other talented artists as well; I think all of them are great!)
