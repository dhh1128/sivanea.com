*And those priests were ordained after the order of his Son, in a manner that thereby the people might know in what manner to look forward to his Son for redemption. — [Alma 13:2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/13.2?lang=eng#p1)*

<p class="poetry">He's judged as worthy, called to serve,
presented to the family by
the father of the ward. "Send me,"
he says, "I'll go and do divine,
redeeming servant's work." Sustained
with lifted hands, ordained, sent forth,
he knocks, asks offerings for the poor.
About age twelve, a trip with mother
brings him eager to the temple,
pleased to learn and study, and
about the Father's business.
He walks on Sundays by each row,
then stands and waits, hand stretched out still.
To each he offers bread of life
and drink, and cleansing covenant.
The feast is broken, cupped, and private.
drawn from shrouded burial white.
He blesses, later, praying that
disciples may be sanctified. 
He grows in wisdom and in stature
till his hour of mission comes —
then into wilderness he goes;
seeing kingdoms of the world,
he chooses service and denial.
Sent to gather scattered Israel,
years go by, and twelve companions:
cried repentance, joy, and prayers.
In time he holds a boy on lap, lays
hands on mother-in-law, and raises
from her bed a sick young girl.
To brother dead in sin he calls,
"Come forth!". He teaches scriptures, weeps,
calms troubled hearts at night, invites
his flock to kneel in daily prayer.
He goes about, just doing good.
Five thousand and four thousand times,
he fills the board with daily bread
and praises Father for it. Temple
hours become his zeal, especially
near the end. Then, sensing death,
he comforts loved ones, urges faith,
and slips beyond the veil — to bless
his flock where mortal limits drop,
to take a perfect body up,
and once again to dwell with Him
whose love and name and arms he's claimed
by priesthood order, followed.</p>
