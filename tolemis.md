Tolemis is a persona that I (Daniel Hardman, daniel.hardman+spotify@gmail.com) created to capture my instrumental [AI collaborations](ai-collab) that have a New Age/Synthwave/Soundtrack vibe. Tolemis is inspired by my lifelong appreciation for Vangelis, and I use this persona to create soundtracks for my novels, among other things.
