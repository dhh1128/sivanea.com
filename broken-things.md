(acoustic guitar intro)

[Verse 1]
God must love broken things—He made a world full of them
Cracked clay that holds the rain, wheat from winter-killed stems
Pruned vines that bear the weight of every August bloom
Ground that has to break apart before there's any room

[Refrain]
He's got a way with broken things
Turns the fallow into green

(short acoustic guitar interlude)

[Verse 2]
God must love broken things—He keeps every one of them
I saw an orphan with half a toy, limping up to ask
If there was any fixing it, or if it's too far gone
The man just smiled and said bring here, let me see what's wrong

[Refrain]
He's got a way with broken things
Holds what no one else would keep

[Verse 3]
God must love broken things—He makes a home for them
I come from fighting and from silence, both cuts just as deep
My mind's a room I'm scared to enter when the dark comes on
But there's a light that finds me even when I think it's gone

(short guitar interlude)

[Refrain]
He's got a way with broken things
Shines when it's too dark to see

[Verse 4]
God must love broken things—He became one of them
He knows the weight of wood and nails, the way a body breaks
How love pours in right where we split, how scars can shine like gold
The world throws out what can't be fixed—He calls it worth the hold

[Final Refrain]
He's got a way with broken things
What the world throws out, He holds close
He's got a way with broken things
Broken things grow beautiful
oh yeah
Broken things are beautiful
to Him.

(acoustic guitar fades and resolves to root on final note)
