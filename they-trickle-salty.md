      Such a touching poem.  I love it!  I noticed the photo credit is More Good Foundation.  Are you affiliated with them?  My son is the COO, and I do some volunteer editing for them.  BTW we both felt that your talk today was excellent.

      I don't have any direct connection to the More Good Foundation, although I "liked" them on Facebook and I think they're doing great stuff.
      
      I read your son's bio &mdash; impressive!
      
      Thanks for the feedback on the poem. There's really no good way to distill an experience as rich and varied as a mission down into a few words, so I decided to settle for one little glimpse. Happy memories. :-)

<p class="poetry">They trickle, salty&mdash;
the beads of sweat
through the parched testimony
of many miles dust,
etching the lines of concentration.
He puffs them off his nose with each gasp,
<cite>...hope María's home</cite>
each weary cycle
<cite>...hope they've prayed</cite>
of legs and mind
<cite>...Please, Father.</cite>

They trickle, salty
through sunny children with nervous smiles;
dark eyes that say:
<cite>...Otra vuelta.</cite>
Wine and milk without price...
<cite>...No, gracias.</cite>
Tears on darkened pillow
record the worth of souls;
stiff knees say <cite>Please, Father.</cite>

They trickle, salty
with white clothes, open smiles,
the quiet majesty of peace-filled testimony.
They say <cite>Gracias.</cite>
The thirsty come, buy, and eat;
they say <cite>Lo haremos.</cite>

They trickle, sweetly,
forever,
tears of joy.</p>
