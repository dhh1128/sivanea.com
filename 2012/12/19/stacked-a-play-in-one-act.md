Fun project.

Here's the description from the book's back cover:
<blockquote>Are human beings doomed to muddle through a dreary existence, bereft of hope? Can we do better than put a brave face on it, as <a class="zem_slink" title="Albert Camus" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Camus" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Camus</a> recommended in "The Myth of Sysiphus"?

In this classic response to existential favorites such as "<a class="zem_slink" title="Waiting for Godot" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waiting_for_Godot" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Waiting for Godot</a>" and "<a class="zem_slink" title="Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosencrantz_and_Guildenstern_Are_Dead" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead</a>", two actors wrestle with science, religion, an unseen director, and their own choices about how they'll interpret the script they've been given.

Eminently readable and easy to stage, this edition of the play now includes discussion questions for classroom learning and book groups.</blockquote>
