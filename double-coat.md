I was driving through Logan canyon west of Bear Lake, Utah, in late April, when I spotted a clearing beside the river. The bushes and the grass beneath them both looked furry to me, and the contrast in size and texture reminded me of how some animals grow a double coat each winter, then shed it in the spring.
