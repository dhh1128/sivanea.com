# Harrow
![harrow logo](assets/harrow-logo.jpg)

Harrow is a persona I (Daniel Hardman, daniel.hardman@gmail.com) created to capture my [AI collaborations](ai-collab) that have a country/folk vibe. Harrow is a gravelly baritone who sings with acoustic guitar and not much else. The vibe I'm going for is honest songs about heartache, hope, and being human — for people who know tears can be sacred.
