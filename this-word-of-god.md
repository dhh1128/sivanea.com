*And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.<br>
&mdash; John 1:14*

<p class="poetry">This Word of God invites our hearts to hear:
Its tones turn stable straw to palace silk,
Call starlight forth as fireworks for a king,
Name lowing cows and sheep its heralds.

This Word of God, it murmurs, snuffles, cries:
Rough swaddling clothes supplant most royal robes,
And shepherds, mud on boots, turn courtiers,
While dim and narrow manger serves as throne.

This Word of God sings soft into the dark.
Small fingers, round a motherâ€™s thumb, a scepter,
The stink of toil and livestock, rich perfume,
Young girl, repute impaired, its pedigree.

This Word of God says something sweet to us &mdash;
Lives lonely, dark, abandoned, stark and chill &mdash;
Immanuel births our drear story, too
If we will hear Him, seek Him, speak Him still.</p>
