As a learning exercise, I wrote a little piece of music in GarageBand. It's for 3 pianos (although I recorded it for 3 guitars, because my music generator doesn't sound very good for piano). The music is in the key of C, and it's probably easy enough for a young piano student to play.

I think it evokes a kind of easygoing, cheerful bit of mischief. Imagine barefoot kids on a hot summer day, getting out the hose, then discovering that it's more fun to squirt each other than to water the lawn. After they get thoroughly soaked, they spreadeagle on the hot driveway to let the sun dry them off...

(And btw, it sounds much better with stereo headphones, so you can hear how the three parts contribute differently.)
