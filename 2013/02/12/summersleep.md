the dreamfabric unravels, dissolves, refocuses--
into selfconscious wakethought.
around a smooth curtain of quiet black velvet
the leaves of the birch tree swishsigh by my window.

muscles stretch in the oh-so-sleepy pleasure
of a slooow stiff bodyyawnnnn.
the ceiling creakconverses with a sleepy cricket chorus
and the leaves of the birch tree rustle by my window.

a pleasant zephyr flows softly, smoothly, soothingly
its inky silk coolness slowly wraps me up,
then tickles, trickles, slides feathersoft across my bare feet
and the leaves of the birch tree whisper by my window

another yawn, and nubian night is a waiting world of summertimesilence
dreamily murmuring sweet secrets...
of seas and ships and sealing wax...
and of leaves of birch trees that sing softly by my window
tree leaves...softly whisper...by my window...
