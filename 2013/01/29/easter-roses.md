The skeptics pull time from their pocket
and sneer at our roses--
our
roses--
the ones we planted, deep and tender,
hand in hand, together.

They talk of leaf and grief and winter,
and do not understand our treasure--
the one the Father sealed to us,
hand in hand, together.

It's Easter's song; it's promises;
it's soil and rain and sun and Spring
and rose hips--
our
rose hips--
rose hips to be planted,
deep and tender,
hand in hand,
together.
