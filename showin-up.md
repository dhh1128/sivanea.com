# Showin' Up
(I came up with concept and verse structure; chatgpt and I crafted the words together)

<p class="poetry">
white lines turn mud, dandelions, and grass to fields.
Kids sprint breathless across in the late morning glow.
She shoulders a blanket, tugs a hat, shakes a chair,
Not watching the score or where the ball might go.
But her girl blocks a shot, sees Mom cheering there &mdash;
Sometimes that’s enough to show you care.
</p>

<p class="poetry>
He planned to cruise life in cadillac style,
But dreams get cashed when the rent comes due.
Now he drives to the place where the boxes grow,
Punches numbers like he’s s’posed to do.
Not the life he pictured when he was young —
But it buys shoes and wagons and meals for the home.
</p>

<p class="poetry">
[Chorus]
Showin’ up when you lack easy answers,
Showin’ up when your heart and your hands just shake.
Maybe all you can offer is the time that it takes.
Faith's not loud or showy, it’s quiet and tough —
Yeah, the hardest, maybe truest work of love
Is just showin’ up.
</p>

<p class="poetry">
The guard scans his keys, clangs open the gate,
Flips through his worn bible, sits back at a screen.
He stands, waits, and smiles, prays a worry unseen,
checks for sheep who're missing, too loud, too quiet, today.
Then listens, invites, tells a joke, speaks a name.
They might lose his words, but they keep that he came.
</p>

<p class="poetry">
She left. Well, no sermons; he just needs an ear,
And someone who won’t pick sides, rail, or pry.
So his friend doesn't talk much, just sits with the tears,
Watching fire sink to blue in the lowering sky.
And the crickets don’t judge, and the brother's got time.
Together they look for hope that won't die.
</p>

<p class="poetry">
He’s thin as a whisper, hurting hard, sleepin’ light,
Machines toll the time where words never reach.
She read him the notes from paper and online,
A story, a memory, a question, a crayoned scene...
The grace ain’t in money or in miles or in fuss —
It’s hearts being present, “We’re still with you — that’s us.”
</p>

<p class="poetry">
[Bridge]
There’s a thousand ways to say you care,
But most fade fast in busyness and talk.
Sometimes, love show best, simply standing there --
Being present is how you walk the walk.
</p>

<p class="poetry">
Showin’ up when you ain’t got answers,
Showin’ up when the road gets rough.
When all you can do is just be there enough.
Love don’t need polish, proof, or fancy stuff —
The bravest, holiest thing we do
Is simply showin’ up.
</p>
