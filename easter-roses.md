<p class="poetry">The skeptics pull time from their pocket
and sneer at our roses&mdash;
our
roses&mdash;
the ones we planted, deep and tender,
hand in hand, together.

They talk of leaf and grief and winter,
and do not understand our treasure&mdash;
the one the Father sealed to us,
hand in hand, together.

It's Easter's song; it's promises;
it's soil and rain and sun and Spring
and rose hips&mdash;
our
rose hips&mdash;
rose hips to be planted,
deep and tender,
hand in hand,
together.</p>
