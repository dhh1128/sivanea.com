<p class="haiku">did prehistoric
spiders scuttle through the sand,
cast webs dried to stone?</p>

I'm sure a geologist could give a better explanation of the seams and cracks in this rock &mdash; perhaps mud dried, compressed, cracked, and then had seepage with different minerals &mdash; but spiders grabbed my imagination first. :-)
