      I was told by the property owner that the bird in question is a Vireo (possibly this subspecies: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warbling_Vireo http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/WarblingVireo08.jpg)

This beautiful little bird had flown head-on into the glass. It twitched for a few seconds and then lay still.

Jesus said that no bird would fall to the ground without God's sorrow. Such an interesting--and poignant--glimpse into the divine nature!Â I had never appreciated it until this morning.
