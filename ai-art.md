# AI art
A lot of the artwork here was created with AI &mdash; typically [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/), sometimes [Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/images/create) or [DALL-E](https://openai.com/index/dall-e-3/) or [openart](https://openart.ai/) or something else. If you see art or photography that is not otherwise credited, this is its source. I stopped noting AI as a source next to every individual instance of such art, because it's so common.

I don't necessarily identify the specific AI that I use, because sometimes it's more than one, or sometimes I've forgotten. For me, the attribution principle that matters is to not claim for myself artistry that originated elsewhere. See my [AI User Code of Conduct](https://dhh1128.github.io/papers/ai-coca). 

My own contributions to such art are sometimes trivial &mdash; just describe what I want. However, they're usually a bit more involved. It's rare for me to get what I want with my first request, and there is some skill involved in designing and refining the prompts. Usually, I give instructions about perspective, lighting, and artistic style, and I have to experiment. Often, I do post-editing. Often, I find photos that approximate what I want, and show them to an AI to guide what it produces. Sometimes, I compose multiple AI outputs into a single image. Therefore, it would probably be inaccurate to say that this artwork is purely the product of AI. It is more of a collaboration, though the AI provides most of the artistic horsepower.
