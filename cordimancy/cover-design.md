Cover design for <em>Cordimancy</em> was done by Donna at DHMDesigns, through 99designs.com. I am very happy with how it turned out.

If you've ever wondered how artists and authors collaborate on cover art, you might be interested in <a href="http://99designs.com/book-cover-design/contests/cover-fantasy-novel-heart-magic-559900/brief" target="_blank">the brief that suggested visuals for what was in my imagination</a>.

Over 150 cover designs were submitted. <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/cordimancy-cover" target="_blank">Here</a> is the survey that I used to pick among the six finalists. (If you take the survey, you can see all the designs in detail.)
