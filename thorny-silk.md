<p style="text-align:center;">spikes bristle, covering
every growing inch in thorn--
green treasure hides? where?</p>

I find it ironic that this particular tree is known as a "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floss_silk_tree" target="_blank">floss silk</a>." It is entirely covered in sharp thorns--not exactly smooth on the skin! However, it <em>is</em> beautiful.

Took this from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugarloaf_Mountain_(Brazil)" target="_blank">Sugarloaf</a> (Pão de Açúcar), looking down into the harbor in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
